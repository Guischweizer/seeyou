That's a simple test with a react lib **https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-webcam**        
We have used Material-UI, and react-router-dom so before you start the project make sure all the packages are updated       
**If you want to install the package you can choose between**       
>npm install        
or      
>yarn install                   

If everything was updated you can execute with      
>npm start      
or      
>yarn start     

That's all guys, Jah Bless!
